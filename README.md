# The DAO


## What is it?
A Standard DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) framework written in JavaScript to run on the blockchain. 

Feel free to reuse to create your own Decentralized Autonomous Organization using this framework.

**Reference:** *"Decentralized autonomous organization to automate governance" -* [White Paper](https://download.slock.it/public/DAO/WhitePaper.pdf) - [Primer](https://blog.slock.it/a-primer-to-the-decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao-69fb125bd3cd)



## Disclaimer

The future remains a work in progress.

**If you create a DAO it will be your DAO, and you will be responsible for its operation.**




## Overview

Our Standard DAO Framework allows people to create Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) governed by the code in this repository written immutably to the blockchain.

We are making the Standard DAO Framework we developed free and open source, so it can be reused by anyone wishing to put together a transparent organization where governance and decision making systems are immutably programmed in the blockchain.

This DAO model is open source under the GPLv2, so it can be reused by anyone wishing to put together a transparent organization where governance and decision making system are immutably programmed in the blockchain.

Note: Although the word "contract" is used in The DAOâ€™s code, the term is a programming convention and is not being used as a legal term of art. The term is a programming convention, not a representation that the code is in and of itself a legally binding and enforceable contract. If you have questions about legal enforceability, consult with legal counsel.
